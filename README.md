# Cellular Automaton
Inspired by John Conway's Game of Life. My goal is to build upon his idea and try to add more lifelike properties. Also my first Processing project using p5.js

## Features:
- Float values (0.0-1.0) for cells
- Pause with spacebar. Then R for a random world and C to clear
- Debug mode with stats printing on screen

## How to contribute?
To use browser-sync for a live reloading dev server
- `browser-sync start --server -f -w`

[Interesting read to transition from python to js](https://realpython.com/python-vs-javascript/)

## More ideas to explore:
- click to edit cells
- prebuilt templates to add to the board
- add random probability (possibly changing)
- refine continuous value concept
- read images as starting points
- track history over time (lerp maybe)
- what if cells travel to an env they feel more suitable?
- nested automata?
- evolution?
- use audio signals?
