# Cellular Automaton
Inspired by Conway's Game of Life. This is my first project using Processing so things might not industry standard.

## Features:
- Pause with spacebar

## Instructions:
You need to have [Processing](https://processing.org) installed (tested on Processing 3 on mac). If using vscode to edit the code, the [processing plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobiah.language-pde) and [java extention pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) are good to have.

To run the code in the Processing editor, just open the `.pde` file and press the play button. For vscode, install processing-java in the mac home dir (`/Users/{username}/processing-java`) and configure this path in vscode. Then `cmd+shift+b` compiles and runs the code.
